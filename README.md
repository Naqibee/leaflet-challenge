# leaflet-challenge

What we will do in this project:

 The tasks are provided by the boot camp and those are as below:

Part 1: Create the Earthquake Visualization
Part 2: Gather and Plot More Data (Optional with no extra points earned)


We are working here on the part 1:

- Dataset provided through this link http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php 


After importing the data from this website the project will go by these steps:
- Using Leaflet, create a map that plots all the earthquakes from your dataset based on their longitude and latitude.

- Your data markers should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.


- Hint: The depth of the earth can be found as the third coordinate for each earthquake.

- Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.


- Create a legend that will provide context for your map data

- Your visualization should look something like the preceding map.
